# Hybrid AI: Local & Cloud Analysis & Comment Moderation

A demonstration of hybrid AI using Chrome's Prompt API (local inference) with Google's Gemini AI fallback (cloud inference) for multimodal tasks: analyzing images to generate accessible alt-text and moderating comments for constructive conversation.

## ✨ Features

- **🔬 Hybrid AI**: Uses Chrome's Prompt API locally when available, falls back to Gemini cloud AI
- **🖼️ Image Analysis**: Upload images and get AI-generated alt-text descriptions (cloud AI for vision)
- **💬 Comment Moderation**: Real-time analysis of comment tone and content (local or cloud AI)
- **🔄 Regeneration**: Re-analyze images for different alt-text perspectives
- **💾 Local Storage**: Images and comments are saved locally (no server required)
- **🛡️ Content Safety**: Blocks problematic comments with constructive suggestions
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works great on desktop and mobile
- **⚡ Performance**: Local AI provides faster response times when available

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Browser Compatibility

This demo works in all modern browsers, with enhanced features in Chrome:

- **Chrome with Prompt API**: Full local + cloud hybrid experience
- **Other browsers**: Cloud AI only (requires API key)

### 2. Get Your Google AI API Key (Optional for Chrome)

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key" and copy the generated key

### 3. Set Up the Application

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Serve the files** over HTTP/HTTPS (required for file uploads):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   
   # Then open http://localhost:8000
   ```

### 4. Configure Your API Key (If Needed)

1. Open the application in your browser
2. If Chrome's Prompt API is not available, you'll see an API key configuration section
3. Enter your Google AI API key and click "Save Key"
4. The key will be stored securely in your browser's local storage

## 🎯 How to Use

### Image Analysis

1. **Upload an Image**:
   - Click the upload area or drag and drop an image
   - Supports common formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
   - Maximum file size: 10MB

2. **Get AI-Generated Alt Text**:
   - Gemini AI automatically analyzes your image
   - Receives a detailed, accessible description
   - Click "🔄 Regenerate" for alternative descriptions

3. **View Results**:
   - Alt-text appears below the image
   - Copy the text for use in your websites or documents

### Comment Moderation

1. **Write a Comment**:
   - Type your thoughts in the comment box
   - Comments can be about the uploaded image or general discussion

2. **AI Analysis**:
   - Each comment is analyzed for tone and constructiveness
   - ✅ **Constructive comments** are posted immediately
   - ⚠️ **Problematic comments** are blocked with suggestions

3. **View Comments**:
   - All approved comments appear in the comments section
   - Comments are saved locally and persist between sessions

## 🧠 How It Works

### Image Analysis
- Uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for fast, accurate image understanding
- Generates detailed alt-text focusing on accessibility
- Considers visual elements, colors, text, and context
- Optimized prompts for web accessibility standards

### Comment Moderation
- Analyzes comments for problematic content including:
  - Personal attacks or insults
  - Hostile or aggressive tone
  - Discriminatory language
  - Bad-faith arguments
- Provides constructive alternatives for blocked comments
- Allows genuine criticism and polite disagreements

### Local Storage
- **Images**: Stores up to 10 recent images with their alt-text
- **Comments**: Saves all approved comments locally
- **API Key**: Securely stored in browser's localStorage
- **No Server Required**: Everything runs in your browser

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Integration
- **Google Generative AI REST API** via fetch requests
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model for optimal speed/quality balance
- Structured JSON responses for reliable parsing
- Error handling and user-friendly messages

### Security & Privacy
- API key stored locally in your browser only
- Images processed by Google AI but not stored by Google
- No external servers or databases required
- All user data stays in browser localStorage

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern browsers** supporting ES6+ features
- **File API** for image uploads
- **localStorage** for data persistence
- **Fetch API** for HTTP requests

## 📚 Use Cases

### For Web Developers
- **Accessibility**: Generate alt-text for images at scale
- **Content Moderation**: Implement AI-powered comment filtering
- **Prototyping**: Quick multimodal AI integration examples

### For Content Creators
- **Alt-Text Generation**: Make your content more accessible
- **Community Management**: Maintain positive discussion environments
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Streamline content preparation

### For Educators
- **AI Literacy**: Demonstrate practical AI applications
- **Web Accessibility**: Teach the importance of alt-text
- **Ethics**: Discuss AI moderation and bias considerations

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Rate Limits
Google AI Studio provides generous free tier limits:
- **15 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**
- **1 million tokens per day**

For production use, consider upgrading to Google AI Pro.

### Customization
You can modify the prompts in `script.js`:
- **Image analysis prompt** (line ~168): Adjust for different alt-text styles
- **Comment moderation prompt** (line ~284): Change moderation criteria

### Storage Limits
- **Images**: Limited to 10 recent uploads (localStorage constraint)
- **Comments**: No practical limit for typical use
- **Total Storage**: ~5-10MB depending on browser
